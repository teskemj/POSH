### Title

Let's talk about Advanced Functions!

### Elevator Pitch

Getting started in PowerShell typically involves your first command, which then evolves into several commands. Then you realize you can reuse this stuff and viola, your first script! Now you're thinking functions...why stop there, let's kick it up a notch by making it an Advanced Function!

### Description

I don't think there's a person who _can't_ use a refresher on some of the basics of PowerShell. It sounds weird to call *Advanced Functions* basic, but it really is part of that early learning process. We start with our first command, and then it evolves pretty quickly into a script, which then evolves into a function. At that time, our function may be doing eleventy-nine different things. Then we learn allfunctions should do *ONE* thing, full stop. Great, now we have eleventy-nine different functions and if the author gets hit by the beertruck, no one will know their purpose! That's where advanced functions barges in! Let's tidy up those functions and make them usable for anyone with comment-based help while at the same time, look at parameter validation and error handling. In this session, that's exactly what we'll do! We'll go from zero to advanced function hero in 45 minutes
